            <p>This is why most modern traffic lights use what are called detectors, which allow the phases to be altered in real time. 
Most traffic lights use inductive-loop detectors to identify road users waiting at a light; 
this system uses a series of underground wires charged with alternating current to detect a vehicle once it rolls over the circuit..</p>

            <p>The self-driving cars being worked on today have many different sensors and cameras to capture information about the world and rely on computer vision, machine learning, and many other programs to interpret and react to that information. 
The goal is to create cars that are safe, perhaps even safer than human drivers, and efficient..</p>

            <p>Hand gesture recognition is a subset of computer vision that focuses on recognizing meaningful human hand shapes or movements. 
It is widely used in interactive systems for games, virtual reality, sign language recognition, robotics, and more. 
With the rise of deep learning, hand-gesture recognition has become more precise and efficient..</p>
